### 3️⃣ How to add new rows
- You **don’t type in the table itself**. Instead:  
  1. Create a new note in the `Tarot` folder (e.g., `The Lovers.md`).  
  2. Add its metadata (frontmatter).  
  3. Switch back to the dashboard note → the table updates automatically.

### TL;DR
- Copying the **Dataview query** doesn’t create rows.  
- Rows come from **notes with frontmatter**.  
- Preview mode = where the “magic” happens.

- Don’t try to edit it in “Edit mode” and expect it to change the table.  
- **Switch to Preview mode** (click the little eye icon or press `Ctrl/Cmd+E`).
